Soution:  Failed to connect with ip /192.168.10.2:8081

Basically we set ip address of development environment using this command :  Run as administrator
 cmd to change Ip:
-> ipconfig
-> setx /M REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME {Ip wireless address}

due dynamic changing of ip address previous ipaddress has set on vs code.

=> kill-server running using 'npx expo start'
=> close vs code and again run vs code .

you'll see ip address will be successfully changed..

Solution: dependency is not iterable.

remove file in temp folder ..
path of temp folder: C:/users/gujjar/appData/local/temp

OR

window + R	
and type => %temp%

and delete files in it .

=> kill-server and again run npx expo start.
